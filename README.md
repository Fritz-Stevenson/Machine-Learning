# HepC-Modelling
Predictive Modelling for Hepatitis C and Liver Disease:

The dataset that was used for this project can be found at "https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset"

This is an Investigation of blood test variables as they relate to liver health and hepatitis C. After exploring the data relationships, this project will aim to create a predictive modelthat can assert liver functions determinations.

The Jupyter Notebook is a final draft that is the most readable/reproducible code in this repository.

After division into training and Test sets, this model predicts Liver Function with 98% accuracy, despite relatively weak correlation between any one variable and Hepatitis C. It is worth noting that despite the accuracy of the model, like most models it doesn't confirm causation from any factor involved. Predictive modelling is effective in problems like this as it calculates relationships and distances in a system, rather than the limited scope of a regressional relationship which has mixed correlation.

It should be noted that with the small dataset provided (615 entries), unclear correlation from variables, and the magnitude of possible conclusions derived from using this for personal medical information, this model is for educational purposes.
