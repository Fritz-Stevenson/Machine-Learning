# HepC-Modelling
Predictive Modelling for Hepatitis C and Liver Disease:

The dataset that was used for this project can be found at "https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset"

Investigation of blood test variables as they relate to liver health and hepatitis C. After exploring the data relationships, this project will aim to create a predictive model
that can assert liver functions determinations. It should be noted that with the small dataset provided (615 entries), this is for educational purposes as the statistical 
confidence is not sufficient to draw real world conclusions.
